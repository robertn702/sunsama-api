# Sunsama API Methods - MVP Checklist

## 🎯 MVP Goal
**Implement basic API methods to validate authentication works with real endpoints**
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Success**: Can make authenticated API calls and retrieve data from Sunsama

---

## 📋 Core MVP Tasks

### 1. Research Sunsama API Endpoints
- [ ] Identify the specific endpoints for `getUser`, `getTasksBacklog`, and `getTasksByDay`
- [ ] Document expected request/response formats for each method
- [ ] Understand required parameters (e.g., date format for `getTasksByDay`)

### 2. Implement Three Core API Methods
- [ ] `getUser()` - Get current user profile/information
- [ ] `getTasksBacklog()` - Get tasks in the backlog
- [ ] `getTasksByDay(date)` - Get tasks for a specific day
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types for all responses
- [ ] Add error handling for API-specific errors

### 3. Test Authenticated Requests
- [ ] Create test that authenticates and makes API call
- [ ] Verify cookies are properly sent with requests
- [ ] Verify responses are properly parsed
- [ ] Handle common HTTP errors (401, 403, 500, etc.)

### 4. Manual Testing
- [ ] Test with real Sunsama credentials
- [ ] Verify login flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Verify API calls return expected data
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues)

---

## 🧪 MVP Validation

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Login with valid credentials → Make API call → Receive data
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials → Receive proper error
- [ ] Make API call without authentication → Receive 401 error
- [ ] Session persistence across multiple API calls

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Can authenticate and retrieve user data via `getUser()`
- [ ] Can retrieve backlog tasks via `getTasksBacklog()`
- [ ] Can retrieve daily tasks via `getTasksByDay(date)`
- [ ] Proper error handling for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Cookie-based session works for multiple requests

---

## 🎯 MVP Success Criteria

**Working prototype that can:**
1. [ ] Authenticate with real Sunsama credentials
2. [ ] Make authenticated API calls to retrieve data
3. [ ] Handle authentication errors gracefully
4. [ ] Persist session across multiple API calls
5. [ ] Provide type-safe responses for API data

**Example working code:**
```typescript
const client = new SunsamaClient();
await client.login('real@email.com', 'password');

// Should work after authentication
const user = await client.getUser();
const backlogTasks = await client.getTasksBacklog();
const todayTasks = await client.getTasksByDay('2024-01-15');

console.log('User:', user.name);
console.log('Backlog tasks:', backlogTasks.length);
console.log('Today tasks:', todayTasks.length);
```

## 🚀 Implementation Order

### Day 1
- [ ] Research Sunsama API endpoints for the three methods
- [ ] Implement `getUser()` method
- [ ] Add TypeScript types for user data
- [ ] Basic testing with authenticated requests

### Day 2
- [ ] Implement `getTasksBacklog()` method
- [ ] Implement `getTasksByDay(date)` method
- [ ] Add TypeScript types for task data
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Manual testing with real credentials

### Day 3
- [ ] Final validation and testing
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Polish and cleanup
