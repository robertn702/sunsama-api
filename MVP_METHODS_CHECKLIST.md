# Sunsama API Methods - MVP Checklist

## 🎯 MVP Goal
**Implement basic API methods to validate authentication works with real endpoints**
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Success**: Can make authenticated API calls and retrieve data from Sunsama

---

## 📋 Core MVP Tasks

### 1. Research Sunsama API Endpoints ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Identified GraphQL endpoint: `https://api.sunsama.com/graphql`
- ✅ Found `getUser` operation with full query structure
- ✅ Research `getTasksBacklog` and `getTasksByDay` operations
- ✅ Document GraphQL request/response formats

### 2. Implement Core API Methods
- ✅ `getUser()` - Get current user profile/information
- ✅ `getTasksBacklog()` - Get tasks in the backlog
- ✅ `getTasksByDay(date)` - Get tasks for a specific day
- [ ] `streamsByGroupId()` - Get streams by group ID
- ✅ Implement proper TypeScript types for user responses
- ✅ Add GraphQL error handling

### 3. Test Authenticated Requests
- ✅ Create test that authenticates and makes API call
- ✅ Verify cookies are properly sent with requests
- ✅ Verify responses are properly parsed
- ✅ Handle common HTTP errors (401, 403, 500, etc.)

### 4. Manual Testing
- ✅ Test with real Sunsama credentials
- ✅ Verify login flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Verify API calls return expected data
- ✅ Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues)

---

## 🧪 MVP Validation

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Login with valid credentials → Make API call → Receive data
- ✅ Login with invalid credentials → Receive proper error
- ✅ Make API call without authentication → Receive 401 error
- ✅ Session persistence across multiple API calls

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Can authenticate and retrieve user data via `getUser()`
- ✅ Can retrieve backlog tasks via `getTasksBacklog()`
- ✅ Can retrieve daily tasks via `getTasksByDay(date)`
- ✅ Proper error handling for all failure scenarios
- ✅ Cookie-based session works for multiple requests

---

## 🎯 MVP Success Criteria

**Working prototype that can:**
1. ✅ Authenticate with real Sunsama credentials
2. ✅ Make authenticated API calls to retrieve data
3. ✅ Handle authentication errors gracefully
4. ✅ Persist session across multiple API calls
5. ✅ Provide type-safe responses for API data

**Example working code:**
```typescript
const client = new SunsamaClient();
await client.login('real@email.com', 'password');

// Should work after authentication
const user = await client.getUser();
const backlogTasks = await client.getTasksBacklog();
const todayTasks = await client.getTasksByDay('2024-01-15');

console.log('User:', user.name);
console.log('Backlog tasks:', backlogTasks.length);
console.log('Today tasks:', todayTasks.length);
```
